ðŸ¤– Parcel Delivery Robot â€“ Eloquent JavaScript
This project is based on Chapter 7 of the book Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke. It simulates a parcel delivery robot navigating a virtual village. The goal is to build various robot strategies and evaluate how efficiently they deliver all parcels.

ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
Graph representation of a village map

Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript

Immutable data structures

Simulated robots with different movement strategies

Measuring algorithm performance by counting turns

ðŸš€ How It Works
The village is modeled as a graph of locations connected by roads.

Parcels have a pickup and delivery location.

The robot moves from location to location, picking up and delivering parcels.

Strategies like random movement, fixed route, and goal-oriented movement are implemented and tested.
